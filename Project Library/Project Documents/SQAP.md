# Purpose & Scope
The goal of this project is to create a mobile application powered by an AI model that evaluates movie or TV soundtracks. The app provides users with recommendations for similar media (movies and TV shows) based on their musical preferences. Users can log, track, and curate their favorite soundtracks while receiving tailored suggestions. The application draws inspiration from platforms like Letterboxd and combines the metadata collected via APIs such as TMDb and Spotify to curate personalized user experiences (UX). The contract lists that the application should be made available on IOS and have an AI model created that is trained by metadata. The SQA team of Savy Software will ensure the development and implementation of the AI model, front-end UI, and API integrations meet defined standards for the client.  

The vision is to elevate how entertainment is consumed by integrating music as a central factor in media discovery, creating a unique and immersive experience akin to the synesthetic moment in Ratatouille where flavor combinations produce visual bursts of color. Some of the risks include: that the AI will give accurate results based on how the user interacts with the model, the UX/UI design is usable for the user, and that the API calls are available for the data necessary. With risks in mind, the team and can work to mitigate these risks through planning to address these problems.  

# Definitions and Acronyms
| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| API  | Application Program Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs provide a standardized way for developers to access and use the functionalities of a particular software or platform. [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) | 
| AI model | Arificial Intelligence (AI) model is a program that has been trained on a set of data to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions without further human intervention. AI models apply different algorithms to relevant data inputs to achieve the tasks, or output, they've been programmed for. [AI models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model#:~:text=An%20AI%20model%20is%20a,they've%20been%20programmed%20for.) |
| UX | User experience (UX) is the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product, service, or system. It includes a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) |
